R Demo Projects
 
R is a useful tool for data analytics.  This repository contains R projects that I have used to enhanced my own R Programming and Data Analytics skills.  These projects span small demos of data manipulations in R to large scale econometric programs.  
 
This repository contains the following Projects:
