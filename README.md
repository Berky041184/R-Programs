# R Demo Projects
 
R is a powerful opensource tool for data analytics.  This repository contains R projects that I have used to enhanced my own R Programming and Data Analytics skills.  These projects span small demos of data manipulations in R to large scale econometric programs.  
 
This repository contains the following Projects:  

#1. Monte Carlo Simulations. Date Published: Spring 2014.
A group project from Graduate School demostrating various mean estimates by using a Monte Carlo Simulation that generated 1 million parameter estimates for each mean method. The R code and Power Point of Final Results are provided in the repository. The entire R code was done by me and was used for the final conculsions made in the power point.
